            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <l>IN Summer every living thing on Earth</l>
                  <l>Seems new created, and receives new Birth.</l>
                  <l>Beauties abroad their blooming Sweets display,</l>
                  <l>Flowers open, Fruit-trees blossom, Beau's are gay,</l>
                  <l>Summer's a time for all things—but a Play.</l>
                  <l>The Summer does the Labourers Harvest yield,</l>
                  <l>Fleets put to Sea, and Armies take the Field.</l>
                  <l>Bold was the Ship (so we are told by <hi>Horace</hi>)</l>
                  <l>Which first launch'd out, and this his tale makes for us.</l>
                  <l>For greater is the risk of Vent'rous Wit,</l>
                  <l>Which rashly dares an untry'd Bark commit</l>
                  <l>To the smooth Deep of a deceitful Pit.</l>
                  <l>Yet you have been on these Occasions Kind,</l>
                  <l>And our Young Authour hopes from you to find</l>
                  <l>A flowing Tide, and favourable Wind.</l>
                  <l>Let me Plead for him then; Pray show him favour,</l>
                  <l>For if we lose him now, he's lost for ever.</l>
                  <l>Should He fail quite in this; I know his Nature,</l>
                  <l>Too bashful to attempt to mend the Matter:</l>
                  <l>Young Poets still their Modesty discover,</l>
                  <l>But theirs, like ours, or yours, is quickly over. <stage>To the Pit.</stage>
                  </l>
                  <l>Let this, against your judgment stand the Test,</l>
                  <l>Show Mercy now, and judge him in the rest.</l>

                     <l>On you, my surer, nobler Hopes depend,</l>

                     <l>You taught me first my Genius and my Power,</l>

                     <l>Your Lines run all on easie, even Feet;</l>
                     <l>Clear is your Sense, and your Expression sweet.</l>

                     <l>Serene and smooth, as Crystal Waters flow.</l>
                     <l>Smooth as a peaceful Sea, which never rolls,</l>

                  <l>DO you not wonder, Sirs, in these poor Days,</l>
                  <l>Poets should hope for Profit from their Plays?</l>
                  <l>Dream of a full Third Day, nay, good sixth Night,</l>
                  <l>(Especially considering how they Write.)</l>
                  <l>But so it is; and thus I go to show it,</l>
                  <l>Wo to us Players, every one turns Poet.</l>
                  <l>All Write alike, and therefore every Brother,</l>
                  <l>Free from all Envy, stands by one another;</l>
                  <l>They live more peaceably than Bees, no doubt,</l>
                  <l>Since not one drone of all is driven out.</l>
                  <l>Our Author is so green, and young a thing,</l>
                  <l>'Tis hard if he can yet have lost his Sting!</l>
                  <l>Those Boxes! He may beauteous Gardens call,</l>
                  <l>Fair are the Flowers, and he sucks Sweets from all;</l>
                  <l>Nor is he less oblig'd to Masks and Beaus,</l>
                  <l>Who pay for Plays; even when they borrow Cloaths.</l>
                  <l>On your united Favours he depends,</l>
                  <l>And thinks you all his, and our House's Friends.</l>
                  <l>Tho' you hate Blood-shed, out of pure good Nature,</l>
                  <l>As Poets, Criticks, or as Fops hate Satyr.</l>
                  <l>Be not to Day afraid to see as Bleed,</l>
                  <l>But let for once, a Tragedy succeed.</l>

                        <l>Go now, and send my Rival off—but stay,</l>

                  <p>THe greatest, and indeed almost the only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, a Poet reaps from what He writes, is the opportunities he meets with of making himself known to the best, and greatest men of his Age. A Play is first made publick in the Theatre; and when it comes to the Press, if any one has spoken kindly, and favourable of it, in the Representation, the Poet chooses him for his Patron; He having before (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Authors Construction) chosen him for his Poet. The distance I am at from the City, and ev'n from the Kingdom too, will keep me Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant for some time, what success this Play (which I Humbly offer to your Patronage) may meet with. If the Town is pleas'd with it, I shall be pleas'd with my self for pleasing them; if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it, I shall be apt to conclude so many in the right, rather than my single self. You saw it in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript, and I have this early and auspicious Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that You approve of it. <hi>Boadicea</hi> pleas'd them, and I receiv'd a very great additional satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, when I understood how particularly it pleas'd You. I will not go to compare that Play, and this together, nor follow the custom, of reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the last performance best; and showing the greatest fondness of the Youngest Brat. The Rhime was the only thing that recommended that; and
<pb facs="tcp:65842:61"/> for ought I know, the only thing too, that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend this. I could wish for something distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing in it, because it is sacred to you, and I should desire to be known to you at advantage. If the pains in writing will endear it to you, it cost me much more than the former. It has some sort of design besides (such as it is) but I was never very guilty of Plotting. I can hardly keep the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters in my Play, from being as honest, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, as I would be my self in a Dedication. A vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Character disturbs me while I draw it, and it grates me to delineate a Villain. 'Tis certain no Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et can excite any Passion in another, if he does not feel it first in himself. Who then will choose to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe discontent, envy, or revenge, when they may have such fair Fields as Honour and Vertue, to range in; all there is bright before them, and the Flight the Muse takes thence, is Heavenwards? Such Characters, artfully, and justly drawn, will excite the good and great to be Patrons; and such Patrons as You (Sir) will soon teach Poets to draw such Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters. You are endow'd with all the Blessings of Nature and Fortune, and you are as Liberal of the gifts of the latter to others, as she has been to You. So great is your Estate, it would be unwieldy to have it more; and such good use is made of it, that envy does not wish it less. It is not consum'd in vain, and superfluous Equipage; but laid out in maintaining the old, open English hospitality. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, in want, is supply'd; and honesty in distress, is succour'd and sustain'd; great without Titles,
<pb facs="tcp:65842:61"/> and good above greatness; rich, rather to others than your self; and seeming only as your own Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Your inclinations, and endeavours are the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good of mankind; and none ever went from you dissatisfyed; delighted in obliging others, and pleas'd to see them pleas'd with your Bounty. Wishing the welfare of all men, and speaking well of all men, is a sure way to meet with an universal return of good will and good wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. He doubly enjoys his Fortune, who has it wish'd double, by all that know him.</p>
                  <p>Among the Prayers of others accept of the prasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the Poet; humbly and heartily, tho' feebly offer'd. I now begin to experience, how much the Mind may be influenc'd by the Body. My Muse is confind, at present, to a weak and sickly te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement; and the Winter Season will go near to over-bear her, together with her houshold. There are Storms, and Tempests to beat her down, or Frosts to bind her up, and kill her; and she has no Friend on her side but Youth to bear her thro'; if that can sustain the attack, and hold out, till Spring comes to relieve me, one use I shall make of farther life, shall be to show how much, I am,</p>

                  <l>LOng has our Author beat his addled Brains</l>
                  <l>To purchase Fame, but can't find Ways, and Means.</l>
                  <l>They talk of Fame, but 'tis the thought of many,</l>
                  <l>They ne'er regarded that, nor writ for any,</l>
                  <l>But wholly plodded how to turn the Penny.</l>
                  <l>That is the Plot, which every Poet lays;</l>
                  <l>Thither drives all their aim, and now a-days,</l>
                  <l>Faith, 'tis the only Plot you'l find in Plays.</l>
                  <l>Yet when poor Author is in greatest need,</l>
                  <l>Seldom, ah! seldom does his Plot succeed.</l>
                  <l>His way would be in this unlucky Age,</l>
                  <l>Not to write for, but write against the Stage.</l>
                  <l>The monyed men would then his Cause defend:</l>
                  <l>City Security's a special Friend.</l>

                  <l>Make you grow Rich;— that's if a Poet can.</l>

                  <l>But Poets with the love of Courts are Curst,</l>

                  <l>And reckon'd useless, for their very Wit:</l>

                  <l>Who, as time serv'd, still threw their mask aside.</l>
                  <l>Why is there of designing madness mention?</l>
                  <l>Poets have still run mad thro' no intention.</l>

                  <l>MOst Poets spread abroad an idle rumour,</l>
                  <l>They never found an Audience in good humour.</l>

                  <l>In finding fault lies all their dear delight,</l>
                  <l>And yet they read as little as they write.</l>
                  <l>If e'er they write, they let no Creature know it,</l>

                  <l>With as much pains as you would take to show it.</l>

                  <l>And to Equip him, you must make the Purse.</l>
